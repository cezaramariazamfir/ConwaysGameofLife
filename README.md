# Conway's Game of Life

This project combines two functionalities: a simulation of Conway's Game of Life and a message encryption/decryption system using XOR operations. Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway, while message encryption/decryption provides a basic example of cryptography.

The code for this project is written in assembly.
  
## Features

**1. Conway's Game of Life simulation:**
  Allows users to specify the size of the grid (m x n) and the number of generations (k) for the simulation.
  Reads input for the initial configuration of live cells.
  Implements the rules of the Game of Life to simulate the evolution of the grid over k generations.
  Outputs the final state of the grid after k generations.

**2. Message encryption/decryption:**
  Supports encryption and decryption of messages using XOR operations.
  Reads a message and a key from the user.
  Encrypts or decrypts the message based on the specified operation.
  Outputs the encrypted or decrypted message in hexadecimal format.



## Usage

**For Conway's Game of Life:**
  1. Follow the prompts to input the size of the grid (m x n) and the number of generations (k).
  2. Input the initial configuration of live cells.
  3. The simulation will display the evolution of the grid over k generations.

**For Message Encryption/Decryption:**
  1. Choose between encryption (0) or decryption (1).
  2. Input a message to be encrypted or decrypted.
  3. Input a key for encryption or decryption.
  4. The program will output the result of the encryption or decryption in hexadecimal format.
